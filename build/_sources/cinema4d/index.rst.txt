**General Workflow**

- Balloons. Flying away. With no aerodynamics. Just make the gravity negative
- Maya to C4D Translate: Curves do not carry over properly. That is because in Maya you have to rebuild the curve. Resulting to 0,1 span and cubic
- Scaling: You need to be in object mode
- Points that are not currently selected can be welded by clicking on the first point and selecting the second point while simultaneously pressing the Shift (the newly welded point will lie at the mid-point of the welded points) or Cmd/Ctrl (the newly welded point will lie at the position of the second point) key.
- Pending
- Multiple bend on both side.
- deformer restrict to a selected object rather than hierarchy.
- Rotation Snap https://www.c4dcafe.com/ipb/forums/topic/84025-rotation-snap/
- C4D Hair As a Voronoi fracture Source
- Freeze Node
- Use the image sequence for the face set-uip. then just traverse.
- Color mapping to clip the highlights
- Change the axis by RMB the pivot axis.
- if you want to prototype of cubes and cloner. just use the matrix isntead
- You can add another mograph as a field.
- LIke splines, you can render volume data. you need a mesher
- Using Voronoi to create bubbles.
- Click Insert for the blue green pivot
- Spherical Camera. It should be in camera perspective
- Spherical camera is not present in the viewport. You need to render it for the preview.
- Spherical Camera render at the eye view.
- typing "num" on multiple selected object in parameters. set s the internal value of the object

**Motion Tracking Workflow**

- Limitation: Tracks are removed if you reload another footage
- Limitation: Unable to extend the tracking for frame range, once it is set.
- Workaround is have two motion tracker. One for the old and one for the new. Then just copy the tracks of the old motion tracker to the new tracker.
- RGB Values of a footage can now be used to enhanced the tracking. It's in the manual track.
- 
- **Animation Workflow**
- On Motion Clip workflow (such as for Mixamo), add motion clip to the tPose (Yes, keyframe this still) and other motions.
- Camera Morph Bug: Switch to Single Morph then control Z
- Motion Clip: Needs three keyframes for it to bake properly
- This bears the huge advantage that you do not have to create a separate tag for each of these Child objects. However, do not add a Motion System tag to an object within a hierarchy that is already affected by a Motion System tag. A tag that already affects a hierarchy should also not be assigned to or copied to another tag. In either of these cases, unwanted effects would result
- Reduce modification is coooler than i thought
- Wheel using the the circumferene and the time track field ( to animate both the position and rotation at the same time. Thanks)!


**Modelling Workflow**
- http://www.teoalida.com/design/apartmentplans/
- Getting the seashore boole. The land must have both caps available.
- And order of the hierarchy matters


**Texturing and UV Workflow**
- UV is hopeless in C4D. Don't bother.
- Reverse normals affects toon cel shader.
- Cel shading using Fresnel.
- Cel Shading using Lumas shader. This is a specular shader. Then have a colorizer. Smooth to none. Amazing.
- Proximal Shader. Another cool one under theeffects. You can have that circular blow using a plane (with proximal)and the sphere with correctional. (2) Displace i (3) Metaball colors merging. (4) The edges for alpha.
- Reflectance Diffuse is not part in the GI illumination.
- Merging the UVs. Be sure no textures is applied or all else mag combine sila.
- You can actually use multiple UV sets. To specify what material applies to UV set, just need to rearrange it in the object manager. Also,  Set the texture tag of the second material to Mix Textures
- Fall of shader. Based on the normal of object like creating moss and dust. Apply this gradient.
- Create generic wood texutre. Use: Luka Global Scale 500. Relative Scale 100 500 100.
- The low and hi object must be visible when baking. Otherwise it won't work. It should be intensity centered and must have the same frame rate.
- Use distorter to vary the edges of the mask.
- Noise layer with the Levr mode. Changing the contract. Its nice to create variation of the alpha.

**Dynamics**
- For fabric use very small flexion and high stiffness values
- Values smaller then 5% will do fine. Also common fabric is rather stiff (will not elongate much when pulled). Using Stiffness values of 100% or above will ensure this.
- EPS (Epsilon) values determine the area around a surface in which a collssion will be detected. Usualy this should be set to values of 1/10 – 1/100 of the object size.
- Polygon EPS < Edge EPS < Point eps
- If the colliding meshes are equaly subdivided you might only need point or edge collission, thus speeding up calculation.
- Geometry of collision also matters.
- Dynamics does not dwell well in small scale. So even if it is a plant. Scale it up.
- The Cloth Dynamics and Rigid Body Do not interact.
- On the Spline Dynamics, increasing the steps beyond 3 is actually counter productive. I had it at 72! and it was the one causing me all the trouble
- Iterations equals the number of points in the spline
- The instance dynamics where you you simulate at low res and change it to high res
- Softbody> Stiffness 1000 and Elastic Limit 1cm
- Plastic
- you need cloth surface to tear

**Grooming Workflow**
- Hair Add Guides - Interpolated.
- Clumping first then kind, frizz
- Hair 0.3cm and 0.3cm. Taper it to help the anti aliasing
- Use the editor. Change to Hair Lines. You can use symmmetry.
