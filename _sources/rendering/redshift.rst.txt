Redshift
#############


General

- In redshift, normal map is being phase out. Use bump map instead.
- Use Displacement Node. But need also to have a redshift tag on the object,. Set the maximum duisplacement and displacement scale
- AO texture (Out Color) > In Color Multiplier (Albedo or Diffuse)
- Gama ovverride on noncolor data
- Using the Ramp as a mediator.
- When placing multiple copies of a Redshift Proxy in a scene, it is much more efficient for memory and performance to create a single Redshift Proxy and then create multiple instances of this proxy and place them as desired.
