Mograph

General
-------

- https://madmograph.com/page/2/ (Medical Animation)
- Sample node to sample the sound effector
- nd you can also cache MoGraph stuff (except MoSpline and PolyFX) with the MoGraph Cache tag
- Mograph Effectors as Deformers.
- That blend feature in the cloner.
- Ha! Finally a useful nugget for the Fracture. Disconnect the faces. And instead of using the split command every time. Just add in the Fracture and in explode and make it editable.

- fake subsurface effect from tim claphan
- back lighting fake. subsurface
- flickering lights on the mograph shader
- using voronoi connector to have a mor e
- morgraph weight object to have a more detailed look
- random effector with weight
- keyframe the weight to  0%
- mograph sorted to show that there is only one clone tp show as random
- You can drag a vertex map to another vertex map’s fall off
- Voronoi Fracture
-     Forces – Straight Forces/Laterial
-         Torque – Rotational Forces
-             Force Refresh – A
-                 Texturing the inside and outside the wall: Search Wall Break Series (Voronoi Fracture)
-                     Generating from the edges.
- You can drag the vertex map to the displacer
- Instancing painting on terrain. Hair object in the cloner.
