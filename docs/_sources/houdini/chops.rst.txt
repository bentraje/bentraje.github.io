CHOPS
************

- in the user interface, the rotation is in degrees.
- in vex, it is in radians.
- in the attribute scope channel sope.
- P.x doesn't work. It has to be P(0)
- envelope helps you to smooth out the incoming signals.
- mops ignore zero fall offf prims
- the mops delay is not actually the equivalent for c4d delay effector
- it would mops springs effector
- If you'd like to generate stepped curves, try using the Count CHOP.
- Your CHOP track names need to be absolute paths. Otherwise they will not work.
- Geometry in CHOPs don't scale well. Simply because you are layering channels over geometry attributes, and other simulation data. Try avoiding this at all costs.
- CHOP Any nodes associated with this network type are built for editing animation curves and audio data.
- Pretty much anything that involves a curve, creates a curve through motion, or has a relation to cos,tan and sin can be edited in a CHOP network.
- velocity damping is in the actual vellum solver.
